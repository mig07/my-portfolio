          I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
          Currently I am a finalist student of the Master's degree in Computer
          Science and Engineering, at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa

          I consider myself a very eager person when it comes to learn new
          topics. I always feel driven by my sheer will of curiosity, which
          keeps me learning new things everyday, being this one of the reasons
          why I followed my academic education in Computer Science.
